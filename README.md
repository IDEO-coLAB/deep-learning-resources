### Generative adversarial networks (GANs)

[Tensorflow implementation of DCGAN](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow)

[Tensorflow implementation of WGAN](https://github.com/jiamings/wgan). This looks useful for understanding how to implement the critic (or discriminator) loss in practice. Haven't tried running the code.

### Datasets
