### Generative adversarial networks (GANs)

[Tensorflow implementation of DCGAN](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow)

[Tensorflow implementation of WGAN](https://github.com/jiamings/wgan). This looks useful for understanding how to implement the critic (or discriminator) loss in practice. Haven't tried running the code.

### Long short-term memory Networks (LSTM)
[Keras LSTM Text Generator](https://github.com/ChunML/text-generator). This is a implementation of LSTM in Keras. I referred to it to understand the textual encoding. It has a corresponding [blog article](https://chunml.github.io/ChunML.github.io/project/Creating-Text-Generator-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Network/).

### Capsule Networks (Geoffrey Hinton's Dynamic Routing: State of the art for MINST)
[Tensorflow implementation of CapsNet](https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow).

[Capsule Networks](https://github.com/llSourcell/capsule_networks). This is a pretty good early explanation of capsule networks. In addition, it has a ipython notebook where it talks about the evolution of convolutional networks and why CapsNets might be the future.

[Adversarial Attacks on CapsNets](https://github.com/jaesik817/adv_attack_capsnet). Haven't tried running this. However it explores ways  in which we can perform adversarial attacks on recognition neural nets. Two things with one repo.

[Keras implementation of CapsNets](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras). Keras implementation also demonstrates reconstruction results. It also has a list of other implementations at the bottom.
